SCENE IDEAS:
    X conveyor belt
    - orbit mechanics
    - simulate waterfall, pooling, evaporation
    - play with heat mechanics (particle stickyness, bound vs. separate)
    - tower defense
    - input/output game (like Zachtronics)
    - physical properties game (change properties to make Rube Goldberg machine work)

CLONE IDEAS:
    - flappy bird
    - pong
    - checkers
    - tetris
    - liar's dice

SIMULATION IDEAS:
    - heat 
        - states of matter
        - heat transfer
    - water cycle
        - rain, pooling, evaporation on a landscape
    - planetary system
        - orbits
        - debris collection
        - rockets
    - circuits

RUBE GOLDBERG GAME IDEA:
    - components:
        X ramp
        X conveyor belt
        X lever and fulcrum
        X cannon
        X pendulum
        - basket on a string (string gets pulled when basket receives item)
        X balloon
        - spring
        - triggers:
            - rope cut
            - on/off switch
        - dominos
        - gears
        - containers with stuff 
        - cart with wheels
