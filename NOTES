SCENE IDEAS:
    X conveyor belt
    - orbit mechanics
    - simulate waterfall, pooling, evaporation
    - play with heat mechanics (particle stickyness, bound vs. separate)
    - tower defense
    - input/output game (like Zachtronics)
    - physical properties game (change properties to make Rube Goldberg machine work)

CLONE IDEAS:
    - flappy bird
    - pong
    - checkers
    - tetris
    - liar's dice

SIMULATION IDEAS:
    - heat 
        - states of matter
        - heat transfer
    - water cycle
        - rain, pooling, evaporation on a landscape
    - planetary system
        - orbits
        - debris collection
